            Keep your homepage minimalistic and free of clutter
            Your website's homepage should communicate your core message instantaneously. After all, we rarely read
            every word on a website. Instead, we quickly scan the page, picking out key words, sentences and images.
            With these known behaviors in mind, it's better to appeal to emotions rather than word count.
