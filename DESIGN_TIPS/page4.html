            Ensure your site is easy to navigate
            It may be in your nature to break the mold, but website navigation is not the place to be avant-grade. After
            all, you want your users to easily find what they're looking for. In addition, a site with solid navigation
            helps search engines index your content while greatly improving the user experience.
